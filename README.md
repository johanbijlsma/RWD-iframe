On this page I will demonstrate how to put a iframe containing a responsive table, to see if how they both react. Note: for this to work, you will have either load in an iframe containing a table that is already responsive, or be in control of that iframe yourself.

Demonstration
A demo can found here: RWD-iframe

How this works
Basically this works quite simple. By adding a few media queries to both the html page
